**TLDR:** [TI9 Fantasy Stats](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1N3cIWGDwqLEtrLnu04zWSfyMQw2gJjpu)

**Preface:**

With match day 1 coming to a close, we get about 10 hours to breath and recalculate our match day 2 selections. Unfortunately, with there being very little data for TI seeing as the most amount of games played were 6, I will still be using Pre TI9 statistics for my predictions. Since that is the case, I went ahead and obtained the predictions for match days 2, 3, and 4 and put them in the folder linked above. I wont be talking about days 3 and 4 in this post, but feel free to look ahead as more than likely those predictions will not change.

Pick whoever has the best bonus stats and who you think will win the most games. I personally am taking rtz and
