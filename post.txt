**TLDR:** [TI9 Fantasy Stats](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1N3cIWGDwqLEtrLnu04zWSfyMQw2gJjpu)

**Introduction:**

Hello there /r/DotA2. I am here to present you a statistical overview of the TI9 fantasy challenge. With /u/SavageSkillet opting out of doing his guide this year, I figured that I could give it a shot. I won't be able to bring as much pizzazz as him, but I hope the data I have gathered is useful to you.


 **Who am I:**

I am [unranked](https://imgur.com/joaSCPV), I have over [2000 hours](https://i.imgur.com/FbD3vHT.png) in Dota, and I have been on/off playing Dota since I got the [beta key](https://i.imgur.com/7DndoUb.png). Professional Dota will always have a special place in my heart as I have spent many days watching tournaments/streams . Funnily enough, my first experience with professional Dota was when I tuned into twitch for TI2's Grand Finals about 5 minutes before [The Play](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tDaJes0T1Ig). Fantasy wise, I was able to get to the 95th percentile at TI7 and 99th percentile at TI8, mostly in part to /u/SavageSkillet's guide. 

**Data Source:**

I spent way to much time trying to web scrape data from DotaBuff because I had to access each individual stats page for each match which resulted in me requesting from their servers WAYY too much (sorry). Im pretty sure they put me on throttle list nearing the end of my exploits, and rightfully so. I ended up finding [OpenDota](https://www.opendota.com/) and started using their API to quickly scrape all the data needed for this guide. Some issues lie with how certain teams have not been together for long and how other teams have barely played against any other TI teams, but this is the best I could do for now pre-TI9. Luckily, I'll be able to run my script and gather each day's data as swift as the wolves of Icewrack and post my findings before fantasy locks at 8pm CST.

**The Data:**

So as I mentioned previously, there are a few players who have not been on their TI team for long and so their data set will be a bit limited. For these [players](https://imgur.com/Z6O0c2p), I have less than 30 games of data, so I suggest that you shy away from using any of their cards at least for day 1.

All of the displayed values (excluding FPpM) will be fantasy points earned within a single game on average. When selecting who to play for each day, always select those who will play the most games and players who are on teams who play [longer.](https://imgur.com/HYSiDfl)

I added a few new stat columns that I haven't seen anywhere before. First, FPpM is Fantasy Points per Minute and measures the fantasy point efficiency of the player. I also added the win/loss averages of both regular per game FP and FPpM. As you can see, many players have strong FP per a game, but their FPpM is lower than that of neighboring players in the rankings. This is indicative of those players having longer games, but not actually being as fantasy point efficient as others. The win/loss averages help see the consistency of players along with how their averages lean. Once the matches are released, I can break down further FP predictions using these new columns.

*[Role Bonuses](https://imgur.com/uNu5GI2)*

On average, each role is pretty close, with the cores being weighed down by offlane players. Each role favors different sets of bonuses on average. But these stats vary from player to player due to different play styles, so below are the AVERAGE best bonuses per a role. For specific FP for each stat from each player, you can read the statsheet linked at the top and bottom of this post. But in reality, card bonuses aren't necessary to make top 10%, as long as you pick the right player, you'll do fine.

Core: Teamfight Participation, Deaths, Kills, Tower Kills, Stuns/Rune Pickups

Mid: Kills, Teamfight Participation, Deaths, Rune Pickups, Stuns

Support: Obs Placed, Teamfight Participation, Stuns, Deaths, Rune Pickups

**Conclusion:**

I had a lot of fun gathering these stats and whatnot. I am working on making a ranking system for the cards to pick using some of these new metrics and see if they are even worthwhile to use. Depending on this post's response, I may make a follow up with a deeper dive into each team/player, most efficient FP heroes, and etc. If there are any other statistics that you would like to see, please let me know as I have a database filled with data just waiting to be queried. For future stats and information, I will populate the linked folder to keep everything all together. 

Thanks for reading this post! Best of luck in the challenge!
