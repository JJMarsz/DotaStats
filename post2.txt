**TLDR:** [Folder of Fantasy Point Statistics](https://drive.google.com/drive/u/2/folders/1N3cIWGDwqLEtrLnu04zWSfyMQw2gJjpu)

**Reprise:**

I made a mistake with my last [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/DotA2/comments/cjrlfy/ti9_fantasy_guide_a_preti_statistical_overview/), by only presenting numbers with my overview. Nobody wants [numbers](https://i.imgur.com/3c7Q4VX.gifv), you guys want graphs! So I have updated my Pre-TI9 Fantasy Book with graphs and split up the bonus data into its own heat map. 

[FP/FPpM Graphs per a Role](https://imgur.com/a/mYW0UCU)

Each graph depicts average fantasy points(FP) or fantasy points per minute(FPpM) with standard deviations versus player roles. Previously I used win_avg and loss_avg, but I have replaced that with high_fp/fppm and low_fp/fppm which are one standard deviation above and below the average respectively. This provides a better range of information as the range for each player now spans the most likely 68% of FP/FPpM for each player, regardless of win/loss. The blue line represents the average across the players with the diamond specifying the average for the player name below. The green range above is the high fp/fppm while the red below is the low_fp/fppm. The closer the range is to the average, the more consistent the player, while the further away from the average shows inconsistency. The columns below the low_fp/fppm are solely there to aid in readability/tracing player to their stats, they serve no statistical purpose.

[Bonus Stat Heatmap per a Role](https://imgur.com/a/o0YMakV)

Each role category got it's own bonus stats spreadsheet that depicts a heat map for each stat point in the same descending order as the corresponding role graph. This sheet is useful to to figure out which of those silver/golds to keep.

If you want to look at the [numbers](https://i.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/newsfeed/000/863/529/2c3.png), go to the folder linked in the TLDR, I will be putting every future spreadsheet/graph/heatmap in there. 

**Creating a Ranking System:**

I will use every statistic that I have gathered to create a fair ranking for each day. FPpM will be used by using the average team

Without further ado, onto match day 1 player card selections!
