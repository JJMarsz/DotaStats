**TLDR:** [TI9 Fantasy Point Folder](https://drive.google.com/drive/u/2/folders/1N3cIWGDwqLEtrLnu04zWSfyMQw2gJjpu)

**Reprise:**

I made a mistake with my last [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/DotA2/comments/cjrlfy/ti9_fantasy_guide_a_preti_statistical_overview/), by only presenting numbers with my overview. Nobody wants [numbers](https://i.imgur.com/3c7Q4VX.gifv), you guys want visuals! So I have updated my Pre-TI9 Fantasy Book with graphs and split up the bonus data into its own heat map. 

[FP/FPpM Graphs per a Role](https://imgur.com/a/mYW0UCU)

Each graph depicts average fantasy points(FP) or fantasy points per minute(FPpM) with standard deviations versus each player role. Previously I used win_avg and loss_avg, but I have replaced that with high_fp/fppm and low_fp/fppm which are one standard deviation above and below the average respectively. This provides a better range of information as the spread for each player now spans the most likely 68% of FP/FPpM that they will obtain, regardless of win/loss. The blue line represents the average across the players with the diamond specifying the average for the player name below. The green range above the line is the high fp/fppm while the red below the line is the low_fp/fppm. The closer the peaks of those two columns are to the average, the more consistent the player, while the further away from the average shows inconsistency. The columns below the low_fp/fppm are solely there to aid in readability/tracing players to their data range, they serve no statistical purpose otherwise.

[Bonus Stat Heatmap per a Role](https://imgur.com/a/o0YMakV)

Each role category has it's own bonus stats spreadsheet that depicts a heat map for each stat point in the same descending player order as their respective FP graph. It ranges from green to red where the greener it is, the higher above average that bonus stat is for that column. This sheet is useful to figure out which of those silver/golds to keep.

If you want to look at the [numbers](https://i.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/newsfeed/000/863/529/2c3.png), go to the folder linked in the TLDR at the top of the page, I will be putting every future spreadsheet/graph/heatmap/number in there. 

**Creating a Ranking System:**

I will use every statistic that I have gathered to create a fair ranking for each day. The FPpM metric will be used by taking the average of the two team's game length and using that length times the FPpM to obtain an expected FP per a game for each player. The FP metric will simply be used on a per game basis, expected FP per a game for each player is the FP metric. For each of those variations, I also obtained a high/low version which will be used to measure consistency across players. So with these 6 FP stats (high_fp, avg_fp, low_fp, high_fppm, avg_fppm, low_fppm) I get 6 rankings that measure different areas of FP earnings. Aggregating them for each player creates a single Super Ranking by assigning points in a linear descending order based off of how many players are getting ranked. e.g. 10 players are getting ranked, 1st place gets 10 points, 2nd gets 9, 3rd gets 8, and so on. Applying this to all 6 categories and aggregating the points for each player gets us the Super Ranking which should be a fair estimate of who to select. I only will be using the highest # of games in my rankings as it is not worth it to use anything less because a single series less on a day on average can be around 30 points. There are edge cases where the worst FP players can earn less points than people who play less games than them, but at that point you wouldn't even consider that player an option anyways. Without further number-splaining, onto match day 1 player card selections!

**Match Day 1 Selections:**

[Rankings]()
As you can see I am only using players that play on teams that are playing the max amount of games (3). 


**Predictions:**

*Super Rankings:*

*Favor High FP:*

*Favor Avg FP:*

*Favor Low FP:*

*Favor High FPpM:*

*Favor Avg FPpM:*

*Favor Low FPpM:*

*Personal Picks:*


**Conclusion:**

Although I am presenting full lineups of player cards, please do not take my words as gospel. I am no expert, I only aggregated data and extrapolated from it. If you reach a different conclusion that works with you, stick to that. If I missed something or if anyone has any suggestions, please let me know, I'd be glad to add something new to these rankings/data. All of this was gathered and extrapolated using a script I made, so obtaining subsequent day's rankings and adding previous day's data to the database can be done very quickly. With the timezone difference, I will (hopefully) be able to post the rankings about 12 hours before the cutoff. I will keep a running tally of what each variation of player card selection earned so we can see which one tends to do better over time. And with that, I wish you the best of luck in the FP challenge and remember to put your predictions in by 8pm CST!
